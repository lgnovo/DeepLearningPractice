# DeepLearning / Neural Network Practice
________________________________________________________________
### Overview
Google Colab was used to write the code in the .ipynb file. The metadata features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier using a deep learning (neural network) design that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. A deep learning model is ideal for its ability to handle large volumes of data, identify complex patterns and adapt, and leveraging dynamic predictive analytics.

### Results
**_Data Preprocessing_**
* Variables assessed:
    - APPLICATION_TYPE — Alphabet Soup application type
    - AFFILIATION — Affiliated sector of industry
    - CLASSIFICATION — Government organization classification
    - USE_CASE — Use case for funding
    - ORGANIZATION — Organization type
    - STATUS — Active status
    - INCOME_AMT — Income classification
    - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS — Special considerations for application
    - ASK_AMT — Funding amount requested
    - IS_SUCCESSFUL — Whether money was used effectively
* EIN and Name are dropped since they are identifiers

### Summary
The target predictive accuracy was 75% and the model is accurate roughly 72.8% of the time, so further development of this model is necessary to meet that ideal.
